The garden grew where the house once stood.

Lena discovered it by accident—sunflowers in a perfect square, tomatoes climbing air, herbs spelling something she almost recognized. The old address matched her grandmother’s, but there was no foundation, no door, no ruins.

She knelt and touched the soil.

“Hello,” she said, feeling foolish.

The wind answered, carrying the smell of bread and soap. The plants rustled, leaning toward her warmth. She realized the rows followed paths she once ran as a child, barefoot, laughing.

Every visit, the garden gave her something: a ripe apple, a sprig of rosemary, a memory she thought she’d lost.

On the final day of summer, Lena brought seeds and pressed them into the ground.

“Remember me too,” she whispered.

That autumn, a new plant grew—small, stubborn, and bright—right where she used to stand.
