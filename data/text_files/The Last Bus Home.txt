🌧️ Story 1: The Last Bus Home

The last bus always smelled like rain and old vinyl. Mira liked it that way—it meant the day was over.

She sat by the window, watching the city blur into reflections. Every night at 11:47, the same man boarded at the hospital stop. Same coat. Same tired eyes. He never paid. The driver never asked.

Tonight, the bus stalled.

Rain hammered the roof while the engine coughed itself into silence. Passengers groaned, but the man stood and walked toward the front.

“Leave them,” he said softly.

The driver froze.

Mira watched as the man opened the bus door and stepped into the rain. For a moment, she saw through him—through the coat, the hands, the eyes—into something pale and flickering, like a memory losing its shape.

The engine roared back to life.

The man was gone.

When the bus pulled away, the driver whispered, “He makes sure everyone gets home.”

Mira pressed her forehead to the glass and, for the first time, didn’t mind the rain.
